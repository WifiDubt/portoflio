        '<p>My name is Filipe Lopes, I\'m :age years old and I\'ve been a Web Developer for about <b>:xp_years years</b> now.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>I\'ve been using <b>PHP/Laravel</b> & <b>MySql</b> since the beginning of my career as well as general web languages (HTML, CSS, JS). For the last <b>:vue_years years</b> I\'ve also been using <b>Vue</b> & many sub-packages of the framework (router, vuex, etc).</p>
        <p>Although I\'m a full-stack developer, I\'ve specialized in a lot of backend functionalities, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>API Integration & Syncronization (specially ERPs)</li>
            <li>Big data management</li>
            <li>Light & Dynamic search functionalities</li>
            <li>PDF Generation</li>
            <li>Calendar management general & scheduling automation</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>As I\'ve mostly worked in/for smaller companies, I\'ve often been required to take a whole project from the planning/budgeting phases, to business work-flow counseling, to migrating data from previous systems to the new app, all the way down to the release, bug-fixing & bug-tracking & continued development of the product.</p>
        <p>I\'ve also learned a lot in terms of client & time management and soft-skills from these experiences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting realistic & achievable milestones, no matter the "size" of the project</li>
            <li>Clarifying what the objectives of a project in a detailed format includes not only what a functionality is meant to do/be but also what it is not meant to do/be. Often the second is even more relevant & further clarifies project objectives</li>
            <li>Always keeping the client aware of development deliverables & their timeline, as well as next steps on project</li>
            <li>Although I strive to be as self-suffient in my work, part of team work is trusting & helping to achive other people\'s visions, even if those don\'t coincide with your own</li>
        </ul>
        <hr class="my-5"/>
        <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I love everything technology related üì±</li>
            <li>Pugs are objectively the best animals in the world. Fight me üê∂</li>
            <li>Love English</li>
            <li>I\'m Portuguese & currently reside in Portugal, but looking to go live abroad</li>
